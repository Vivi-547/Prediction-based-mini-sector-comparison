# Prediction-based-mini-sector-comparison
This notebook predicts future mini-sector performance by allowing user input for driver names, teams, and points. Using historical telemetry data and predictions, it provides visual comparisons of actual vs. predicted mini-sectors. The project integrates FastF1 API to forecast lap times based on past races and driver metrics.
